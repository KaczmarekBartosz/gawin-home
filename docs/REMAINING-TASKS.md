   - Total price display
   - Free shipping threshold logic

5. **Complete Testing**
   - Build verification (npm run build)
   - TypeScript check (npx tsc --noEmit)
   - Responsive design test (mobile/tablet/desktop)
   - Dark mode verification

6. **Create Phase 2D Final Documentation**
   - Update PHASE-2D-CHECKOUT-2025-10-30.md
   - Document main checkout page implementation
   - Add screenshots/mockups (if applicable)
   - List all completed tasks with metrics

## 📞 Session Continuity Notes

### What to Remember:
1. Zod boolean fields need special handling - don't use `.default()` on booleans
2. react-hook-form expects consistent types between Zod schema and form data
3. All 4 step components are production-ready, just need orchestration
4. Dark mode CSS variables are already configured in globals.css
5. Mock data is simple - can use hardcoded cart items for now

### What's Ready to Use:
- ✅ All Zod schemas (just need to adjust boolean types)
- ✅ All 4 step components (fully functional)
- ✅ Validation logic (comprehensive)
- ✅ Dark mode (fully integrated)
- ✅ Responsive design (tested)
- ✅ Design system (colors, typography, spacing)

### What Needs Work:
- ⏳ Main checkout page (app/checkout/page.tsx)
- ⏳ react-hook-form integration
- ⏳ Step state management
- ⏳ Form submission handler
- ⏳ Order calculation logic
